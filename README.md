## Project Organization

This GitHub repository contains all the materials and codes of my final project for the exam of the **High Performance Computing** course of the **Scientific and Data-Intensive Computing** master degree at *Universit√† degli Studi di Trieste* & *SISSA* (2023-2024).

This repository contains two main subfolders, one for each exercise of the assignment:

* **exercise1**: comparison and assessment of different openMPI algorithms for collective operations and models to predict their latencies

* **exercise2**: hybrid MPI+OpenMP code to compute the Mandelbrot set

Each of these two folders contains the requests/tasks of the exercises in the **Assignment** folder, while the **Solution** folder provides the proposed solutions; further details and explanations can be found in the **Solution** folders, specifically in the README files and above all in the **Report_and_slides** subfolders.
